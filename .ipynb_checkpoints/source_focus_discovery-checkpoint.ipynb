Also, should it be fixed in the future, the gully is NOT the best way to access - a mile or so shorted does not = easier. Using Dove Spring Canyon Rd and then SC111 (which is very much like beach sand mostly) is the better way to do it. SC111 seems quite rarely used but the sand gives it a self-maintenance quality - not  rough and rutted.\\n4/2/19 (Devilfish) : So as it turns out there is water at willow spring, WR620: the trough is broken, but inside the fenced enclosure up the hill from the trough around the mostly dry pond basin a white pvc pipe is putting out water at about 25s/liter.

       "71   4/4/19 (Semper Gumby) : Location currently NO GOOD for water resupply. Also, should it be fixed in the future, the gully is NOT the best way to access - a mile or so shorted does not = easier. Using Dove Spring Canyon Rd and then SC111 (which is very much like beach sand mostly) is the better way to do it. SC111 seems quite rarely used but the sand gives it a self-maintenance quality - not  rough and rutted.\\n4/2/19 (Devilfish) : So as it turns out there is water at willow spring, WR620: the trough is broken, but inside the fenced enclosure up the hill from the trough around the mostly dry pond basin a white pvc pipe is putting out water at about 25s/liter. It is low to the ground, so a scoop is needed to draw water from it.\\n3/24/19 : Dry, no water.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

       "43   6/14/19 (Chance Card) : Crossed near trail, where the creek splits around an island. Snow bridge on its last legs for first fork. Forded maybe 20 feet upstream up far side trail. Fast current but never more than knee deep. Consistent footing. Rocks. Second fork was easy. Log upstream is currently submerged but might be an option when creek is lower. Tributaries between Baxter creek and suspension bridge: several and trail is frequently a river. One of them was strong enough to require care. Right around trail, used live pine tree to hold onto during steps across the strong part. Knee high.\\n6/13/19 (Mountain Lion) : At about 0715 when I've seen the powerful stream WA0797 (Baxter Creek according ford report; but Baxter Creek is according halfmile map the creek on the opposite eastside of the valley), I decided to cross not this stream but instead the easier to cross South Fork ? coming from Dollar Lake. Then I hiked the eastside of the valley without any trail near to mile 800 and as well the eastside of the Woods Creek valley up to about mile 803. This had been hard work and took me about 5 hours with some terrible bushwhacking and lose block field crossings. At the confluence of the creek from the south, parallel to the Sawmill Pass trail to the Woods Creek have been a save log crossing with a partly snow bridge.   \n",

       "74   6/2/19 (Devilfish) : willow spring has some green water/muck left, but no flow out of any pipe, trough still broken - can't recommend coming down to it for water when the stream at sageland, at the junction of kelso valley road and piute mountain road, is still flowing so well.\\n4/4/19 (Semper Gumby) : Location currently NO GOOD for water resupply. Also, should it be fixed in the future, the gully is NOT the best way to access - a mile or so shorted does not = easier. Using Dove Spring Canyon Rd and then SC111 (which is very much like beach sand mostly) is the better way to do it. SC111 seems quite rarely used but the sand gives it a self-maintenance quality - not  rough and rutted.\\n4/2/19 (Devilfish) : So as it turns out there is water at willow spring, WR620: the trough is broken, but inside the fenced enclosure up the hill from the trough around the mostly dry pond basin a white pvc pipe is putting out water at about 25s/liter. It is low to the ground, so a scoop is needed to draw water from it.\\n3/24/19 : Dry, no water.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

Faucet has slow leak, more when turned on.  We attached a smaller faucet and hose to outlet however valves are temperamental.  Please be sure to turn valve as close to 90 degrees in order to stop flow.  We will be making additional repairs next week.\\n-----\\nPlease turn the knobs/valves off as hard as you can to minimize the leaking drips.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "29   5/19/18 : Hwy 180 is open.\\n-----\\nThis is your last chance to exit the Sierra westbound (for a long time) via Roads End / Hwy 180 as the bridge ~6 miles west of the PCT from the Woods Creek bridge (Mile 799.8) is OUT. This bridge is not on the PCT but if you decide to exit the Sierra at Woods Creek heading towards Roads End you will not be able to cross the South Fork of the Kings River at the damaged bridge. If you go over Glen Pass northbound and decide to exit the Sierra after Glen Pass you will have to exit eastbound over Baxter, Sawmill, Taboose, or Bishop Pass which are all higher in elevation from the PCT.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

       "25   7/29/19 (John) : Rock creek has great double fallen log crossing 100 yards upstream.\\n6/16/19 (Theresa & Josh) : Rock creek can be crossed on 2' log suspended on rock 6' above water, near mile 760.41 just upstream of where trail crosses creek.\\n6/11/19 @ 10AM (Nadav) :  0.1 up stream on a log.\\n6/5/19 (All-In) : Log crossing. There are two log crossings a few hundred feet upstream from the official trail crossing. One of them has a couple downed logs side-by-side and is clearly safer.\\n5/26/19 (Jack) : First notable STREAM CROSSING is rock creek. We found a log to use a bit before the campsite, but even in the afternoon, the water levels were mild and could be crossed without any trouble.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
